# BoggleSolver

This Java application is intended to solve Boggle-style game boards. It should be able to output all valid words based on a given dictionary in minimal time.

If you're unfamiliar with the game, here are the [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Boggle#Rules).

Using the GUI, the board size and content can be entered, a dictionary selected, and the game solved.

The dictionary file should have one word per line. A sample file is included.

A 'Q' entered on the game board is interpreted as 'Qu', as in standard Boggle.
